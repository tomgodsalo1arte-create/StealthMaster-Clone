# StealthMaster-Clone
In this project, I'm trying to make StealthMaster game. It's not finished yet. Here are some images from the project:

In this project I tried to do:
- Basic AI behaviour to make enemy walk between waypoints, attack to player, chase player, return to default position.
- Field of View for enemies to detect player.
- UI for upgrade system between levels.
- Design unique levels.
